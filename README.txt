Group 2 - COP 4610 Assignment 2

Task 1 - Completed by Eduardo Dotel
------------------------------------------------------
Task 1 was completed by implementing the file system calls create, open, close, unlink, read, and write 
to both the classes UserProcess and UserKernel. Both classes were implemented with methods that called upon each other
to execute certain system calls properly.

Task 2 - Completed by Ismael Pena
------------------------------------------------------
Task 2 was completed by further modifying the UserProcess and UserKernel classes to support multiprogramming.
UserProcess.readVirtualMemory and UserProcess.writeVirtualMemory were modified, for example, for the purpose
of working with multiple user processes.

Task 3 - Completed by Guillermo Casas
------------------------------------------------------
Task 3 was completed by implementing additional system calls called exec, join, and exit for the purpose of
giving the program more performance on using additional features. This task was connected with both task 1
in that it applied a similar concept with its implementation of system calls and task 2 where it used the
methods readVirtualMemory and readVirtualMemoryString for communication between the kernel and the user processes.

Testing - Worked on by Eduardo Dotel, Ismael Pena, Guillermo Casas
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing was being worked on by all of us to debug the program and determine what errors had been found within the program
so we could try to resolve it.
